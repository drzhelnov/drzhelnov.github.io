Dear Colleagues,

An excerpt from the [original publication](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/tcom.pdf) (accessed on July 7, 2021):

> USMLE Physician Tasks/Competencies provides an outline of the tasks and competencies assessed throughout the sequence of USMLE examinations. While this outline is common to all exams, each Step has test specifications specific to that Step. Each Step exam emphasizes certain parts of the tasks/competencies outline, and no single examination includes assessment of all topics in the outline.

**Note** that Step component specifications next to the task/competencies are **not** from the original document but from the official [Step 1 Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/content_step1.pdf) as well as the [Step 2 CK Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-2-ck/Step2CK_Content.pdf) (accessed on July 29, 2021), so please take these accordingly. Alphanumeric codes are also custom. **Also, Step 3 was not considered.**

Interactive features are under development. I presume this outline as well as the [USMLE Content Outline](/usmle/usmlecontentoutline/) could be nicely aligned with my [amalgam USMLE prep schedule made of U.S. med schools syllabi](/usmle/) **so that each task/competency linked to specific study resources per each content topic.** This would effectively create a **self-study roadmap** with tasks/competencies as its **tracks** and content topics as the **milestones.** Naturally, to navigate the roadmap, the prospective Step-taker would need to clear specific resources such as textbook chapters, journal articles, videos, or their [glternatives](http://glternative.com). **QBanks would still be required** to test one’s competencies and topic knowledge once there is something to test.

I do not own any outline content, just reproduce it for self-learning purposes and in good faith:
