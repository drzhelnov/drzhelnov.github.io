# Emergency Medicine Clerkship: Instructional Methods/Learning Strategies

[Emergency Medicine Clerkship - Syllabus (PDF)](/usmle/em/EM-Clerkship-Syllabus-AY2020-21.pdf)

Each clerkship rotation will be composed of a combination of clinical activity and related materials, didactics, simulation, reading as well as a variety of other activities.

<u>Clinical activity:</u> The number of shifts will be no fewer than nine [9] and include days, evenings, nights and weekends, and span all three weeks of the clerkship.   
<u>Simulation:</u> Opportunities to learn through simulation may occur locally, at NEOMED, at ABIA or at any of the NEOMED emergency medicine residencies.   
<u>Didactics:</u> Participation in curricula from both NEOMED emergency medicine residencies and the NEOMED pediatric emergency medicine fellowship is encouraged. <u>Reading:</u> Is required as assigned from the Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer,and encouraged from one of the two main emergency medicine textbooks (Rosen or Tintinalli). **See [Appendix A](/usmle/em/reading-list.html) for the required reading list.** A good text for student purchase is EM Secrets.   
<u>Additional Activities:</u> Extra activities that involve emergency medicine sub-specialties such as EMS ride-along, hazmat, poison center, hyperbaric or palliative care, are encouraged.

A variety of learning strategies will be used during the clerkship to help you achieve your goals.

Strategies may include but are not limited to: 

* Patient encounters in the emergency department
* Small group discussions
* Conferences and lectures
* Workshops
* Core educational lecture videos
