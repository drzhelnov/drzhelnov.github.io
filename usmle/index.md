Dear Colleagues,

Many of us IMGs know how good UWorld is for USMLE prep. In fact, UWorld is a triumph of contemporary evidence-based education. That said, it is rather costly, so a cheaper alternative seems appealing. At the very least, I would like an alternative to it at the knowledge-acquisition phase before I proceed to application of that knowledge, where QBank access is required.

Exploring the alternatives, I am deeply concerned about the USMLE study materials available on the Web. Among the results of a [Google search for: (usmle img study OR prep)](https://google.com/search?q=usmle+img+study+OR+prep), I have only seen study cases (_‘This is how I did it…,’_ either written or video-based) or commercial training courses. The former are anecdotal and mostly feature review materials with no solid tips for foundation-building. The latter are behind paywalls with useful tips available but not the study content itself. Thus, I have looked into an open access, systematic approach.

My idea was to take existing curricula of various (preferably fewer and higher-rated) U.S. medical schools and devise a fixed-term self-learning schedule with a list of required readings for each week (in no particular order within weeks). So I have constructed the table below from both recent and outdated syllabi that I could find with Google in May 2021. I am currently processing the featured textbooks to make the syllabic content available free of charge in the form of [glternatives](http://glternative.com) while also integrating these syllabi with official USMLE practice materials to create the [Interactive USMLE Physician Tasks/Competencies](/usmle/tcom/) and the [Interactive USMLE Content Outline](/usmle/usmlecontentoutline/). This would effectively create a **self-study roadmap** with tasks/competencies as its **tracks** and content topics as the **milestones.** Naturally, to navigate the roadmap, the prospective Step-taker would need to clear specific resources such as textbook chapters, journal articles, videos, or their [glternatives](http://glternative.com). **QBanks would still be required** to test one’s competencies and topic knowledge once there is something to test.

**I declare that I have never taken nor supervised study for any USMLE examination (as of August 2021), so I am currently unable to advise about empirical effectiveness of my study materials.**

**M1** through **M4** denote years one through four at a [typical U.S. medical school](https://lcme.org/publications/#Standards). _Longitudinal_ is a year-long course interspersed with the shorter courses. Not all the curricular content was available for inclusion, but hopefully, this was enough. Sorry for any links that might get broken with time. Consider replacing unavailable readings with similar ones at hand, like I, too, did.

[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/drzhelnov.github.io/blob/master/usmle/index.md) to create a custom copy (also to track versions). Feedback is always welcome via [GitHub](https://github.com/pvzhelnov) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov). My own prep reports are public as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/drzhelnov/drzhelnov.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22USMLE+prep%22) (on hold as of Nov. 20, 2021). Enjoy!
