Dear Colleagues,

Many of us IMGs know how good UWorld is for USMLE prep. In fact, UWorld is a triumph of contemporary evidence-based education. That said, it is rather costly, so a cheaper alternative seems appealing.

My idea was to take existing curricula of various (preferably fewer and higher-rated) U.S. medical schools and devise a fixed-term self-learning schedule with a list of required readings for each week (in no particular order within weeks). So I have constructed the table below from both recent and outdated syllabi that I could find with Google in May 2021. **M1** through **M4** denote years one through four at a [typical U.S. medical school](https://lcme.org/publications/#Standards). _Longitudinal_ is a year-long course interspersed with the shorter courses.

Not all the curricular content was available for inclusion, but hopefully, this was well enough. Sorry for any links that might get broken with time. Consider replacing unavailable readings with similar ones at hand, like I, too, did. [View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/drzhelnov.github.io/blob/master/usmle.md) to create a custom copy.
