## Weekly Objectives

**Cardiac arrhythmias, Atrial fibrillation, and Heart Blocks**

Cardiac Arrhythmias

1.  Describe the anatomy and physiology of cardiac electrical system and explain how excitation-contraction coupling results in cardiac performance.
2.  Describe how systolic murmurs are graded on a 1-6 Levine scale.
3.  Review the ionic basis of electrical activation of pacemaker cells and myocytes.
4.  Describe the mechanism of common arrhythmias, including bradycardias and tachycardias.
5.  Integrate the basics of ECG interpretation for use in diagnosing arrhythmias.
6.  Explain the mechanism by which antiarrhythmic drugs can help in the prevention or termination of arrhythmias.
7.  Recognize the potential role for device-based and ablation-based therapies for arrhythmias.

Atrial Fibrillation

1.  Diagram and explain the relationship between the electrical conduction system and the cardiac cycle.
2.  List the serum biomarkers used to assess myocardial tissue injury.
3.  Describe the pharmacological mechanisms and rationale for using : Coumadin versus novel oral anticoagulants, metoprolol and other beta blockers, amiodarone and other antiarrythmics; ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and Calcium channel blockers.

Heart Blocks

1.  Explain the etiology of bradyarrhythmia’s.
2.  Describe how patients adapt to bradyarrhytmia’s and heart block.
3.  Describe the clinical presentation of complete heart block.
4.  Define sinus bradycardia.
5.  Identify potential causes of bradycardia.
6.  Describe reversible causes of complete heart block.
7.  Describe the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s criteria for first, second and third degree heart blocks.
8.  Characterize the differences in ECG patterns related to various types of heart blocks.
9.  Explain the pharmacology of new oral anticoagulants.
10.  Differentiate the types of pacemakers used, and describe the paced ECG.
