## Weekly Objectives

**Restrictive Lung Diseases (RLD): Neuromuscular Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)**

Approach to Restrictive Lung Diseases

1.  Describe the mechanisms by which restrictive lung disease can occur.
2.  List the pathophysiologic consequences of restrictive lung diseases.
3.  Identify common physical examination findings in restrictive lung disease, differentiating by etiology.
4.  Identify the principal pathophysiologic processes that lead to restrictive lung physiology: neuromuscular
5.  isease, interstitial disease, skeletal anomalies, and pleural filling.
6.  Explain the interventions that may improve restrictive lung disorders.
7.  Compare and contrast clinical diseases associated with restrictive physiology. 

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)

1.  Describe how interstitial lung diseases affect gas exchange at rest and with exercise.
2.  Compare pleural pressure excursions in restrictive interstitial lung disease compared to health and neuromuscular diseases.
3.  Distinguish among inflammatory interstitial lung disease by etiology, pathology, treatment options, and prognosis.
4.  List pharmacologic interventions used in ILD and explain mechanism of action and biological effects.

Neuromuscular Diseases

1.  Explain the effects of neuromuscular weakness on airflow, gas exchange, and cardiovascular physiology.
2.  Differentiate the physiologic consequences of neuromuscular disease from those associated with interstitial lung disease, skeletal anomalies, and pleural space filling.
3.  Compare treatment options for a range of NMDs and discuss mechanism of actions, side effects and drug interactions.
