## Weekly Objectives

**Dyspnea**

1.  Characterize underlying organ system dysfunctions involved in dyspnea.
2.  Compare and contrast cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea.

4.  \\Describe the pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to dyspnea.
5.  Interpret static, dynamic, and exercise pulmonary function tests.
6.  Categorize by class and describe the appropriate pharmacotherapy for pulmonary and cardiovascular causes of dyspnea.
7.  Describe the effects of health care disparities on patient outcomes.
8.  Outline a basic approach to diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
