# Family Medicine Clerkship: Reading

Family Medicine is a broad and diverse field. It combines the traditional biomedical disciplines with particular skills in the analysis and use of community resources; knowledge and experience of organizational and management techniques for the delivery of medical care; and an awareness and ability to understand, diagnose, and use the psychological and social elements that are concomitant of health and disease. This information may be drawn from many sources.
