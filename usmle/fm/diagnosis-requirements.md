# Family Medicine Clerkship: Diagnosis Requirements

Each student is required to see a minimum of one of each and provide documentation in their New Innovations logbook during their clinical rotation.

Students may run a report from NI called “Rotation Requirements Summary” to determine if they are missing any. Gaps should be filled with a corresponding and/or supplemental reading in the [FM Clerkship Top 30 Common Conditions and Presentations Guide](http://guides.utmb.edu/fmclerkship/conditions) online through the Moody Medical Library. These additional experiences should be logged under
**_Alternate_** in NI and include a comment to explain.
