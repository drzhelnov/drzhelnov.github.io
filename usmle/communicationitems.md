Dear Colleagues,

The [NBME Item-Writing Guide](https://www.nbme.org/item-writing-guide) (6th Edition – Version November 2020) lists the following sample lead-ins based on Communication and Interpersonal Skills tasks/competencies:

> - Which of the following is the most appropriate opening remark to this patient?
> - Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the provider?
> - Which of the following statements by the provider is most appropriate to...?

As per the Item-Writing Guide, lead-in questions in good NBME-style items can be answered without looking at the options, so it is prudent to keep this in mind while dealing with sample items below.

The official USMLE® [Step 1 Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/content_step1.pdf) (accessed on July 29, 2021) gives us one sample Communication Item. Additionally, in the official [Step 1 Sample Items (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/samples_step1.pdf) (accessed on August 24, 2021) I could find seven more. In total, this makes eight sample Communication Items taken from official sources, which I reproduce below.

**Note** that the STEP 1 ONLY specification for Communication Items is **not** any official designation but instead was construed by myself from the official [Step 1 Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/content_step1.pdf) as well as the [Step 2 CK Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-2-ck/Step2CK_Content.pdf) (accessed on July 29, 2021), so please take this accordingly. **Also, Step 3 was not considered.**

I do not own any sample USMLE content, just reproduce it for self-learning purposes and in good faith:
