Dear Colleagues,

The [NBME Item-Writing Guide](https://www.nbme.org/item-writing-guide) (6th Edition – Version November 2020) lists the following sample lead-ins based on Communication and Interpersonal Skills tasks/competencies:

> - Which of the following is the most appropriate opening remark to this patient?
> - Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the provider?
> - Which of the following statements by the provider is most appropriate to...?

As per the Item-Writing Guide, lead-in questions in good NBME-style items can be answered without looking at the options, so it is prudent to keep this in mind while dealing with sample items below.

The official instructions from the USMLE® [Step 1 Sample Items (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/samples_step1.pdf) (accessed on August 24, 2021) are as follows:

> **Strategies for Answering Single One-Best-Answer Test Questions**
>
> The following are strategies for answering one-best-answer items:
>
> - Read each patient vignette and question carefully. It is important to understand what is being asked.
> - Try to generate an answer and then look for it in the response option list.
> - Alternatively, read each response option carefully, eliminating those that are clearly incorrect.
> - Of the remaining options, select the one that is most correct.
> - If unsure about an answer, it is better to guess since unanswered questions are automatically counted as wrong answers.

The official USMLE® [Step 1 Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/content_step1.pdf) (accessed on July 29, 2021) gives us one sample Communication Item. Additionally, in the official [Step 1 Sample Items (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/samples_step1.pdf) (accessed on August 24, 2021) I could identify eight more. They were not explicitly labeled as Communication Items, so these are my own personal guesses from their content. In total, this makes nine sample Communication Items taken from official sources, which I reproduce below.

The correct answers are shown as in the original document. I encourage you to review [the official document](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/samples_step1.pdf) to make sure they are indeed correct. The collapsible options/answer blocks were not in the original design, but I added these to facilitate separate reading of item parts.

The items are reproduced in no particular order. Also, please consider the following notice from the [Step 1 Sample Items (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/samples_step1.pdf) (accessed on August 24, 2021) document:

> Although the sample questions exemplify content on the Step 1 examination overall, they may not reflect the content coverage on individual examinations. In the actual examination, questions will be presented in random order; they will not be grouped according to specific content. The questions will be presented one at a time in a format designed for easy on-screen reading, including use of the USMLE Laboratory Values table (included here on pages 5–7) and some pictorials. Photographs, charts, and x-rays in this booklet are not of the same quality as the pictorials used in the actual examination. In addition, you will be able to adjust the brightness and contrast of pictorials on the computer screen.

**Note** that the STEP 1 ONLY specification for Communication Items is **not** any official designation but instead was construed by myself from the official [Step 1 Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-1/content_step1.pdf) as well as the [Step 2 CK Content Description (PDF)](https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/step-2-ck/Step2CK_Content.pdf) (accessed on July 29, 2021), so please take this accordingly. **Also, Step 3 was not considered.**

I do not own any sample USMLE content, just reproduce it for self-learning purposes and in good faith:
