# Neurosurgery Elective Clerkship

[Neurosurgery Elective Clerkship - Third Year Medical Student Handbook (PDF)](/usmle/nsur/New-Student-Handbook-3030-Students.pdf)

**Third Year Clerkships**   
The Department of Neurosurgery at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston offers several opportunities that are open to all third year students at our institution.

* **Surgical Subspecialty Clerkship (SURG 3001)**   
This clerkship is part of the studentâ€™s general surgery rotation. The clerkship will be four
weeks in duration.
* **Neurosurgery Elective Clerkship (NSUR 3030)**   
This clerkship is a separate elective rotation in Neurosurgery. The clerkship will be three weeks in duration.

The clinical clerkships allow students with an interest in neurological surgery to assist faculty and the current residents in all aspects of the neurosurgery service.

These clerkships are intended to give students an insight into the types of patients and problems that may be seen in a typical Neurological Surgery Department. They will have the opportunity to be involved in all aspects of neurosurgical care. We hope this clerkship will be enjoyable and stimulating.
