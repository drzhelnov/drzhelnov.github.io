# Renal, Fluids, and Electrolytes: Week 3

[Course Information Year 2 Courses: Renal, Fluid & Electrolytes](/usmle/rfe/course-information.html)

## Concept Map

Concept maps are intended to help you reason through the PBL material and integrate foundational science mechanisms with the clinical components of the case. Complete the map during self-study time during the week. A _completed_ map will be posted on Friday afternoon for you to check your work/progress.
