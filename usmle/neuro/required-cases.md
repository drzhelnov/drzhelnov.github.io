# Neurology Clerkship: Required Cases

[Neurology Clerkship Information](/usmle/neuro/course-information.html)

Students will observe or participate with faculty supervision one of each case listed below.

*   Cognitive disorders
*   Movement disorders
*   Epilepsy
*   Neuromuscular disease
*   Headache
*   Cerebrovascular disease (stroke)
*   Neuro-immunology (multiple sclerosis)

You will be expected to see at least one case from each of the above categories. Some of these you will be more likely to see in the inpatient setting (cerebrovascular disease), some in the outpatient setting (cognitive disorder), and others may be more ubiquitous (headache). Each student will be issued a copy of Case Files Neurology, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., which can be used to supplement your exposure should you find that you were not exposed to one of these clinical categories during your clerkship. Please return this book at the end of the clerkship.
