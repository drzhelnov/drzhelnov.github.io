# Neurology Clerkship

The Neurology Department offers third-year medical students a two-week traditional clerkship in neurology at the campus sites of Bismarck, Fargo and Grand Forks utilizing clinical faculty members.

Third-year students on the Minot Campus receive neurology education over three months by participating in an integrated longitudinal curriculum.

## Goals and Objectives

The four core objectives for the neurology clerkship are to:

1.  Learn to perform a complete neurologic examination.
2.  Gain an understanding of the presentation, evaluation and treatment of the most common neurologic diseases.
3.  Complete a patient write-up, incorporating pertinent neurologic history and examination.
4.  Develop an understanding for localization of neurologic disease through history and examination.

## Syllabus

You will be assigned a preceptor for the two weeks. Discuss your schedule with your preceptor. As part of your time in the outpatient clinic, we will schedule you a patient to interview, examine and present. You will compose a formalized write-up about this patient to be presented and discussed with your preceptor as part of your overall evaluation. The preceptor evaluation is worth 60 percent of your final grade. You will also partake in didactic lectures, inpatient teaching rounds, and outpatient teaching.

The Department will loan you "Blueprints: Neurology" to prepare for the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Neurology Subject Exam given on the final day of your two-week rotation. The exam will constitute 40 percent of your Neurology grade. The NBME passing score is equal to or greater than 57 Equated Percent Correct. You must pass the exam to pass the clerkship.

At the end of the clerkship, you will be notified by LEO to complete the “Student Evaluation of Clerkship” and “Student Evaluation of Preceptor.” Your preceptor will complete the “Preceptor of Assessment of Student Performance” evaluation from LEO.
