# Critical Care Selective: Patient Experience and Procedure Logs

For this selective, medical students are expected to encounter the following types of patients and clinical conditions and have the indicated level of student responsibility.  

The standardized levels of student responsibility include:

1.  **Observe and Discuss**: This may include observing another member of the team interview a patient, perform a procedure or physical exam, etc. and discussion of the case, condition or other relevant components.
2.  **Actively Participate in Care**: This category indicates more active responsibility for the patient, such as performing a physical exam and workup, entering progress notes or H&Ps, presenting the patient on rounds, as scrubbing into a case or counseling or discussing prevention with the patient.
3.  **Perform Procedure**: This is defined as the student performing the procedure with supervision.  

The following steps should be taken for alternative experiences:

1.  The student will notify the selective director that an alternative experience is needed for a procedure or diagnoses one week prior to the end of the selective.
2.  An approved alternative experience/requirement is completed.
