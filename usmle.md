Dear Colleagues,

Many of us IMGs know how good UWorld is for USMLE prep. In fact, UWorld is a triumph of contemporary evidence-based education. That said, it is rather costly, so a cheaper alternative seems appealing.

I constructed the table below from both recent and outdated syllabi from several U.S. medical schools that I could find with Google in May 2021. Sorry for any links that might get broken with time. Consider replacing unavailable readings with similar ones at hand. [View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/drzhelnov.github.io/blob/master/usmle.md) to create a custom copy. Feedback is always welcome via [GitHub](https://github.com/pvzhelnov) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov). Enjoy!
